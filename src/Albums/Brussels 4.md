Before returning to Texas for Christmas, I had to replace my laptop battery. I planned to go without the laptop for two to three days — even though the repair was, to my surprise, complete the day-of — and on a Monday morning, arrived at the Apple Store in Brussels at 10 to deliver my laptop. With me, I had my iPad for work, and my camera for the rest of the day’s exploration of around the city. These were taken over the day’s walk and following morning that my laptop was in for repair.
