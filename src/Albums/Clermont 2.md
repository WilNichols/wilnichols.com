Every trip to Clermont (see [[Clermont 2]]) is a treat—though I have less to show for it than the previous trip. I had a better time, though, meeting a great dog, another photographer, finding [a great pub](https://www.the-salvation-jane.fr), and finally visiting [Le Saint Eutrope’s cave](http://www.sainteutrope.com).
