We knew by late October that we’d be leaving Pittsburgh, and I had less time and headspace to make art as we planned the departure. My parents visited at the start of October and we visited the Frank Lloyd Wright house on Kentuck Knob. Our friends Abhi and Jenna visited at after Thanksgiving and we took them to Pittsbirdh’s (thanks, Darien) National Aviary. I carried my camera on me everywhere in-between, but inspiration rarely struck.
