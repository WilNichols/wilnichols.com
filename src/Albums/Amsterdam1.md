# Amsterdam 1

We finally made our way to Amsterdam after Lisbon and Porto. Unfortunately, a cold followed us from Porto, but we were able to keep it at bay long enough for me to enjoy the next day exploring while others recuperated. Eladio joined us from Leuven for the night, and we returned to Belgium the next morning.
