# Pittsburgh 1

Before moving to Pittsburgh, I took three weeks here during my sabbatical before moving on to Iceland. It was a crash course in the city—I went from Brookline to Lawrenceville, Highland Park to North Shore and South Side Flats. Finally, two days before flying to [Reykjavik](#routes.albums.iceland2022Urban#), I found the house I’d move into at the end of October.
