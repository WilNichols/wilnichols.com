These shots are from a Sunday in Brussels, with one of the last days of good weather we saw before Winter. We visited for the [Brussels Street Photography Festival](https://www.bspfestival.org/en/home/) display, and then made our way to the [Brussels Beer Project](https://www.beerproject.be). So far, thereâ€™s still more to see with each visit.
