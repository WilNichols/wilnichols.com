I took two and a half days in Paris, meeting Andie and her kids, and returning with them to Auzon. While there, I attended the [Klimt exhibit at Atelier des Lumi√®res](https://www.atelier-lumieres.com/en/gustav-klimt), and got a quick beer again with photographer and my former French professor, [Robin](https://unsplash.com/@robinoode).
