We spent a night in Auzon and a night in Lyon on the way back to Leuven from Florence. On the last day, my friends took a 9am train from Lyon, while I travelled in the opposite direction to reclaim my backpack with my passport and laptop. There had been a detour on our incoming trip, and in the jostle, I’d forgotten the bag — thankfully, on a bus with only three stops. Unluckily, right before the weekend. I was able to locate it by phone that final day, picked it up in person in Modane, and finally arrived back in Leuven not long after midnight.
