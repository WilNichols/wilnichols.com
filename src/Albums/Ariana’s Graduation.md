Ariana and I found a small window for her graduation photoshoot before a [[monthly-notes-no-1 | bustling May]]. I hadn’t been on campus in eight years, and it as conflictingly nostalgic. UT Austin prided itself — and failed — in walking a fine line between a progressive institution and a state school in a backwards state. That said, the nostalgia’s real, and I’m glad to celebrate my loved ones’ accomplishments.
