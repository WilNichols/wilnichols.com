Try the demo. üëÜüèª

Should UI be written this way? No, but it‚Äôs amusing. More seriously, we tend to put our cruft on the JS end of functionality when a surprising amount can be done with HTML and CSS alone. 

Working on components and systems with my team, I often find that designers lacking development experience have a rough time understanding both a component‚Äôs design and programmatic inputs and outputs. Working on this with junior designers, we do an exercise where we compare basic UI elements and see if we can logically recreate one with the functionality of another. For example, radio inputs within a fieldset represent a single selection within an array, which map to a whole host of other elements‚Äîand silly dev exercises like this help to make that point.

{% renderTemplate "njk", renderTemplate %}
  {%- from '../_includes/tabs.njk' import tabs with context -%}
  {{- tabs(codeTabs) -}}
{% endrenderTemplate %}
