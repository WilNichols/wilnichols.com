I was a college sophomore in 2015 when Ambra Gutierrez’s allegations against Harvey Weinstein first surfaced, and a senior when they were revitalized by Alyssa Milano. I was a naive child—I remember being _shocked_ to [learn](https://news.utexas.edu/2015/09/21/campus-sexual-assault-survey-details-prevalence-at-ut-austin/) that one of four women at my university experienced sexual assault. I remember hearing about the Pikes’ “rape dungeon” from friends who rushed[^1], and then I remember sharing this, freshly shocked, over a family dinner later that week—not understanding my mother’s seemingly disinterested response, lacking the self-awareness to realize her apathy reflected she’d long internalized this truth to which I was fresh. 

My younger brother was soon starting his degree at the University of Houston, and I remember her discomfort with “yes, all men.” Her mother volunteered at Amarillo’s rape crisis center in her childhood. In mine, she and my grandmother were paragons of progressivism—contrasting their regressive home state. Despite her lived experience and assertive politics, she worried for undue suspicion being levied against her male children.

It’s Fall 2024, and we’re tracking the Mazan trial. Nine[^2] of Dominique Pelicot’s fifty co-rapists claim that despite Gisèle’s silence and lack of visible consent, they were duped. _Dommage._ That these men so confidently claim innocence despite undeniable [evidence](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/10/04/french-mass-rape-trial-public-and-press-allowed-to-see-video-evidence_6728201_7.html) of their actions reflects on a passive entitlement to the charity of both their fellow men and larger community. 

This brings back the old conversation. Some of these men thought she consented, purportedly trusting her husband to communicate her consent. One thought she was dead. The town's mayor [minimized](https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-mayor-apologies-6d740afb0dfc638123473d93963cb7d4) the crimes against her. For each, an excuse that sidesteps the severity of her pain with the plausibility of their explanation.

I don't know whether or not it's worse for her rapists to realize the extent of their crimes. If they realize and live with themselves, they've discounted her pain and believe that if not deserving grace, they deserve to move forward, unencumbered. A lack of realization may be more honest—they aren't pretending that they're redeemable.

I'm unsure to what degree trying to understand these men's psyches is helpful. Refusing to attempt understanding, however, prevents us from self-reflection. If the scummiest among us believe that their explanations are worthwhile, we must ask ourselves how they feel entitled to our empathy and understanding. If the worst men anticipate understanding from common men—by claiming "oh, I thought she consented"—and we comply, we're culpable. We benefit abusers by prioritizing explanation over outcome.

Yes, all men are guilty—guilty of being the kind of men who support the worst among ourselves.
