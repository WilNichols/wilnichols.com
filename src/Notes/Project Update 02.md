I’ve deployed a number of updates in the last year, but they’ve been small. New notes, stubs for case studies and prototypes, partials for photo albums—but nothing published. This update publishes the photo albums that had last been accessible at [my previous site](https://photography.wilnichols.com), and prepares for a “camera feed” page while I move onto either case studies or design prototypes. As we collapse into a tech-biased Oligarchy, I’m glad to further own and publish my own content instead of relying on social media.
