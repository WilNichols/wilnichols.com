Once more I have a backlog of posts to write, but an unwillingness to voice thoughts to the void. Between a newly-vocal willingness to literally kill homeless campers and lick the boots of your neighborhood gestapo,[^1] I don’t know what good _voicing thoughts_ does anyone. 

So let’s not, at least while in this headspace. Instead I’ve indulged in four weekly tennis matches and practices, until last night where I landed myself in the ER with a 103° fever and bacterial pneumonia. Oops. Sorry, Wil, the tickle in your chest wasn’t ragweed. It’s been a week.

Anyway, Darien and my better judgment are encouraging me to take it easy, and I’m catching up on my photographic backlog. The last photos I posted on Instagram are Simon’s proposal to Ariana. Before that, some of our wedding, and then Iceland. Iceland was September 2022.

For a while, I had a misguided idea that showing signs of life on Instagram would help me find local photo exhibitions.[^2] IRL networking yielded better outcomes, but I kept posting. I enjoy exhibitions, but need to try something else — I’d always sell _a few_ prints, but never enough to make it worthwhile. So Instagram posting dried up, and my friends would never even know that I’d lived a year and a half in Pittsburgh. The same amount of time I’d lived in Belgium, which is extensively documented on the ‘Gram.

So I’ve finished editing my last two sets of Pittsburgh photos — [Pittsburgh 4](/albums/pittsburgh-4/), [5](/albums/pittsburgh-5/) — and my post-wedding pre-honeymoon time in Austin, [Austin 9](/albums/austin-9/). There’s some relief to put the Pittsburgh scenes behind me. My last photos from that period are November 2023, despite us moving in April. I don’t think I took my camera out once. Looking back, it’s a blurry, anxious fog. 

I’m creating art again, but mostly on occasion and less passively. I had a hell of a time in Chicago a few weeks back for Jenna and Abhi’s bachelor and bachelorette parties. Took both cameras and walked left with a couple hundred great photos of the wedding party, that[^3] I’ve already edited. The wedding party and guests received the full 201 to choose from, and I only need to cull the album before publishing here. It’s a great reminder of how much better we’re doing now than in PGH, even when now planning to leave the country. Also, coming from TX, Chicago’s a breath of incredibly fresh air.

I thought I was going to an event at Apple Park this coming weekend, but my doc’s advised me to not go far until I’m fully cleared. Maybe this’ll force a slower, or at least less-avoidant pace. I don’t want less tennis, but it’s been a hell of a convenient way to not twiddle my thumbs in the face of anxiety and impotence. On the plus side, more art, and maybe better plans of _what the fuck can we even do._
