My managerial replacement, [Andrew Domozych](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-domozych){target=blank}  started his role as Manager of Product Design a few weeks back, June 10. Formerly Director of Design, I’m now Staff Designer. This feels _great._ Really, _really_ great.[^1]  

I was promoted to Design Director from team lead following our [December 2021 brand update](https://blog.zello.com/zello-celebrates-10-years-with-a-new-look){target=blank}, inherited a marketing designer and junior product designer as direct reports, and managed them for a year and a half before growing the team. 

Zello’s 2023 Product organization was built upon three pillars — Core,[^2] Growth, and Enterprise — and we decided to hire a Product Designer for each, which required I offload my remaining IC work, primarily design and development for zello.com. I hired a talented [Design Engineer](https://rileysheehan.co){target=blank} to own zello.com while adding other technical skills from high fidelity prototyping to video editing, and a Product Designer for Enterprise. My earlier designer worked in the Core team, and we brought over a high-potential Junior Product Designer from our Product Advocates for Growth.

The designer on Enterprise didn’t work out, and the his successor received an unbeatable offer from Spotify only a month after starting this last Winter. Shortly before his hire, I’d had to let my inherited product designer go. It was a rough half year. I went into 2025 expecting to replace one of the lost product designers, and cover the remaining gap myself until the team’s output has stabilized.

By the end of my directorship, the team was [Sam Valdez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valdezsamanthaj){target=blank}, a wildly talented marketing designer turned visual and brand designer, [Riley Sheehan](https://rileysheehan.co){target=blank} , Design Engineer focusing on design and development for zello.com, and [Angela Cerrillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-cerrillo){target=blank} a product designer focused within Zello’s Growth team.

This size of team meant that I could reliably provide product design IC work for our Core and Enterprise teams — with any more reports, I would’ve been precluded of IC availability, but we’d found that the Core team needed a deep degree of Zello product and platform knowledge, and that was difficult to hire for while not having a margin for labor hours. However, we added a fourth team tasked to reassess old and new product problems with new AI technologies, and again we were hiring.

[^1]: Don’t tell me it’s because I’m in the middle of a three week vacation; there’s no _conceivable_ correlation between feeling great and getting the hell out of town.
[^2]: Push-to-talk is Core, location history is not. Audio quality is Core, SSO is not. Etc, etc. This bends with our user base.
