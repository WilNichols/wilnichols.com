  Sometimes it’s a good thing.

I’ve had this stub of a note rolling around the ol’ head for a number of months now. There’s more to say depending on the week’s mood, but it consistently reduces to dialog between _Today Wil_ and _Old Wil_.[^1] 

I’ll comically write those dialogs out another time. It further reduces to a snide and nihilistic debate investigating the value of small, performative acts. 

Old Wil leans into, one, the idea that performativity is inauthentic because it’s for the sake of audience as opposed to legitimate self-expression. This devalues self-expression for its own sake, which in itself is a poor practice. If your self expression is worthwhile to you and performs no meaningful harm, then _have fun._ Old Wil, two, argued that those who indulge in large and performative gestures do so to the exclusion of meaningful and impactful action. Performativity becomes not just a means, but an ends, accomplishing nothing while patting oneself’s back.

As a straight-passing queer white dude, Old Wil was regularly frustrated by hearing progressive overtures from his actually-straight white male colleagues, resented their posturing in lieu of action, and was growingly disappointed in Progressive Whites’ vocal and loud impotence.

Today Wil is still disappointed in the Progressive Whites. Unlike moderate Democrats with further-left factors, Today Wil can flex to embrace Old Wil, his younger, vitriolic, an debatably less-defeated ally.

Today Wil argues that when a part of or allying with disadvantaged and harassed populations, language and signal is an important means of ingroup signaling, and that signaling is inherently performative. If one doesn’t bother to visibly share their perspectives until there’s opportunity for impact, others looking for friendship, connection, and a safe outlet are left in silence. If one has the comfort and privilege—in my case, as a confrontational straight-passing white dude—use it judiciously, but _use it._ Don’t grow attached to your voice, but show enough to be a known element to those who need it.[^2] 

There are challenges—if one finds themselves in isolation, your role can be to create a space where wider expression is safe. Be wary of speaking for others, or worse, speaking over others. Performance creates a space where together we can do better work, but is not then work in itself, and so it behooves us to regularly self-check. 

I’m putting my “Fuck Greg Abbott” bumper sticker back, because it lets y’all know that I’m one of the cool kids, and that’s good.
