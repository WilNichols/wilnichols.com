Early versions of Zello strictly separated between the Talk and History screens — the user sent and received live voice on one, and received live voice and played back old messages on another. As Zello matured and added other message types, they could be sent from both screens, and I was increasingly interested in sending live voice from History as well. The _big button_ was great where users needed straightforward interaction with few distractions, but I worried that only optimizing that UI decreased opportunities to engage in large channels with text, photos, and other message types that could arrive concurrently with live voice.
