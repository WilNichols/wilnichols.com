Zello had previously made use of methods to animate in-app notifications over the status bar â€” this prototype tested ways to revise those notifications to work on both older devices and the new iPhone X. This pairs with the work done to replace the [Volume Bezel](obsidian://open?vault=Wil's%20Garden&file=Prototypes%2F08%20Volume%20Bezel)
