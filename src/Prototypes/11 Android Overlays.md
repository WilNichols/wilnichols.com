[Matt McDaniel](https://mattmcdaniel.me/portfolio/) designed our [Android Overlays](https://support.zello.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042542411-Using-Overlay-Buttons-Android) feature in our 2019 hackathon. This initial version only allowed messaging via “toggle mode” — tap to start messaging, and tap again to end. I created this prototype to demonstrate that we could disambiguate between tapping-and-holding to drag the overlay verses pushing-to-talk. It additionally allowed users to customize the delay used to disambiguate the two, to customize the tolerance with which we’d consider a touch on the overlay, and further demonstrated new animations we’d later add.
