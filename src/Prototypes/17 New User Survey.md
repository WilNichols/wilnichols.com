I moved to Belgium in early 2018 and wasn’t able to fly to upstate NY for Zello’s third hackathon. Between the time difference and their less-workweek-typical hours, I wasn’t positioned well to iterate on my team’s project. At the project’s kickoff, we discussed methods to deliver a new user survey, the type of question we’d ask, languages we’d support, and different design considerations. I then created a prototype that allowed them to write survey content and visualize it with a number of frontend treatments and compare it between languages.
